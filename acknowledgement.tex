I would like to thank my project supervisor Dr. SC Gupta for giving me opportunity to work under his guidance and for providing the valuable suggestions, discussions and continuous support throughout the course of this project. He guided us to understand the field of Software Defined Networking through the weekly meetings and the course associated with Cloud and virtualisation. The weekly meetings kept us motivated to achieve more learning in the field and deliver the tasks in timely manner. The Floodlight community, especially Ryan Izard, was also very helpful in sorting out the bugs in the technical part of the project. We would also like to thank the baadal team especially Prateek, Kanika for their support throughout the project.
