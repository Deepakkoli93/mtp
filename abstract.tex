In this project, we introduce network virtualisation solution in the IIT Delhi private cloud. Virtualisation is creating logical components from available physical resources. Here we have used Software Defined networking (SDN) as one of the techniques of Network virtualisation. We went through networking architechture of Baadal, and suggested a policy control design for the communication between VMs belonging to different VLAN. By default, the intervlan VM communication is disabled in the baadal architecture. But there may be requirement of communication between two VMs of different vlan sharing workspace for an application. Policy design application make it possible to enable communication between two intervlan VMs. Since we have used Floodlight as SDN controller, it also provides feature of enabling and disabling it through terminal using REST API. We also developed a load balancing application by using statistics of bytes transfer between VMs. Finally we compared the results of both these applications with the traditional networking. We found 100 times increase in bandwidth in case of intervlan VMs transfer.
